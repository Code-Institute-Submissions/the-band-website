                <p>They could do it all. From heavy rock, pop, opera, disco to gospel and they did it all brilliantly.
                    They have certanly made history with all the greatest hits. Twenty years after they stole the show at the original Live Aid concert, and 14 years after the death of Freddie Mercury, 
                    Queen have been crowned the most popular UK band of all time.
                <p>The group, currently on a critically acclaimed comeback tour with former Free singer Paul Rodgers taking on vocal duties, have overtaken the Beatles and Elvis Presley as the artists who have spent the longest time on the British album charts.</p>
                <p>According to the compilers of the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and Albums, Queen have spent 1,322 weeks on the chart, compared with the Beatles' 1,293 weeks.</p>
                <p>The band's first number one album, A Night at the Opera, came out in 1974. But James Bradley, the assistant editor of the Guinness book, said Queen's achievement had taken a comparatively short time: Elvis Presley first charted in 1956 and the Beatles first made the chart in 1963.</p>

                                <p>Moving to London with his family in the 1960s, Mercury attended the Ealing College of Art. He befriended a number of musicians around this time, including future bandmates, drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May.</p>
                                <p>In 1969, Mercury joined up with a group called Ibex as their lead singer. He played with a few other bands before joining forces with Taylor and May. They met up with bassist John Deacon in 1971, and the quartet, who Mercury dubbed Queen,played their first gig together that June.</p>
