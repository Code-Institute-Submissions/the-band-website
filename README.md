	I have conducted tests in virtual mode using the google developer tools and also physical mobile phones including Nokia, Samsung Galaxy, HtcM8, Samsung Tablet S4 and IPhone to check compatibility. In all devices the design and functionalities are at the highest standards level. 
	
	I have used the https://validator.w3.org/ to validate the HTML code and corrected all error or warning messages. 
	
	I have uploaded the CSS file to https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator to check for any error and the result was clear, no error was detected.
